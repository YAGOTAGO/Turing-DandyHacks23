## Introduction
From some of the same minds that brought you (critically acclaimed) 2-Tris, we show you Turing Troubleâ„¢. <br>

In a world where Alan is stuck on a Multi-Tape Turing machine, you must guide our hero to victory by making the correct transition functions. Use our game to learn about simple transition functions and HAVE FUN!

## Code Description
Coded in C# using Unity by Tiago Davies, and Michael Reidy. We created a modular design for levels by using Scriptable Objects (Unity built in data container) to define the crucial information of each level. From there we dynamically load the information into GameObjects that appear on your screens! This made our level making extremely simple as everything is abstracted away, and making a new level is as simple as setting a few fields in the Unity Editor.

## Project Timeline
We made this game for DandyHacks'23, which lasted 43 hours.

## Gameplay
Drag the different blocks from the SHOP into the corresponding places of the same color to make a transition function. Once you are satisfied with the transition table you have made press RUN, and watch Alan. If he makes it to the crown you WIN!

## Future
We would like to add states that change based on SEE to further draw similarities between this game and actual Turing Machines. Due to lack of time, however, we had to go for a more streamlined approach.
